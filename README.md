This repo contains an archive of all US News national college rankings from 1984 to 2024.

The ranking data was collected from https://publicuniversityhonors.com as well as a public dataset provided by Andrew Reiter (cited below).  I then went through manually to make sure each one was correct.

I have also created an online representation of the data which can be viewed here: https://www.aronfrishberg.com/resources/us%20news%20chart/index.html

**This data is entirely for free, public use.**
