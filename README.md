# Archive of US News College Rankings 1984-2023
This repo contains an archive of all US News national college rankings from 1984 to 2023.

The ranking data was collected from https://publicuniversityhonors.com and verified using a public dataset provided by Andrew Reiter (cited below).  To collect the hex color codes of each university, I used the OpenAI GPT4 API to submit prompts and scrape the respective hex colors of each college.  I then went through manually to make sure each one was correct.

I have also created an online representation of the data which can be viewed here: https://www.aronfrishberg.com/resources/us%20news%20chart/index.html

**This data is entirely for free, public use.**
