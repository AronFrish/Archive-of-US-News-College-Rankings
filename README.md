# USNews-College-Rankings-1983-to-2022
USNews college rankings of top colleges from 1983-2023. The data was collected from several sources, with a major one being publicuniversityhonors.com, using the Python requests package. I used it for my own project, which can be viewed at https://bit.ly/3MElnnH. I hope this can be of use to someone else. 

This repository is dedicated to Brandeis University, my future alma mater.
